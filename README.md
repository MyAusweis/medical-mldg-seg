# Domain Generalizer: A Few-shot Meta Learning Framework for Domain Generalization in Medical Imaging
Code for the MICCAI 2020 paper [Domain Generalizer: A Few-shot Meta Learning Framework for Domain Generalization in Medical Imaging]() to be presented at [Domain Adaptation and Representation Transfer (DART) 2020](https://sites.google.com/view/dart2020).

For a comprehensive overview of CT vertebrae segmentation look at the MSc thesis:

[Spine segmentation in computed tomography images using geometric flows and shape priors] (https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/4b29bb21t) by Pulkit Khandelwal, and supervised by [Prof. Kaleem Siddiqi](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~siddiqi/) and [Prof. D. Louis Collins](http://nist.mni.mcgill.ca/) at McGill University.
